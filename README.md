# B+ Tree Implementation in Go

This repository contains an implementation of a B+ Tree in Go.

## Introduction

A B+ Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. It is commonly used in databases and file systems to store and manage large datasets.

This implementation focuses on the core functionalities.

## Features

So far, the following features have been implemented:

- **Node Creation:** Initialize B+ Tree nodes with keys and children.
- **Tree Visualization:** Display the structure of the B+ Tree in a text-based format for easy understanding.

- **Key Insertion:** Insert keys into the B+ Tree while maintaining its balanced property.
